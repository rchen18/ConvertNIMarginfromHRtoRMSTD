# NI-margin-conversion-methods

# Introduction

This example file demonstrate the utilities of our (Chen et al. 2021) proposed NI margin conversion methods when applied to both individual study and multiple studies. The example codes perform data generation and NI margin conversions from a HR measure to a RMSTD measure.

# Required Functions

First load the data generation functions. Two data generation models are included: (a) Weibull distribution (b) Piece-wise exponential distribution. In order to run the funtions, one need to install the R package 'cpsurvsim'.
